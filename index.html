    <p><b>ATTENTION PLEASE!! ATTENTION PLEASE!!! YA'LL THE BABY BOY IN ABOVE PICTURE IS NOW OFFICIALLY 14!!!</b>
    Well my dear, Enjoy today to the fullest okayyy? Hopefully your mother will give you something from your list as your birthday gift and your sister will do something too! Don't forget to do a wish at 11:11 AM or 11:11 PM (you'd probably sleep-) since you won't be blowing candles. Anyways, with me or without me, I want you to enjoy today to your fullest dear. It's not everyday we get to live right? We may die tomorrow or who knows maybe even tonight! But yes, I'm sorry that I won't be present today due to busy schedule but at least we will get to text for an hour...(5pm - 6pm) hehe. But yeah let's see, <i>If I don't go maths paper class today we maybe able to spend time together hehe</i>...</p>

    <p>Today is one of the days I can express my heart to you... First, thank you so much darling, for being supportive to me and being there for me when I'm in my lowest. I'm pretty sure if you weren't here, my soul would have been in hell due to my dumb sudden decisions. God bless you for that. I just wish this distance will end soon... At least we'll be able to meet in the near future. I should be forever thankful for God for letting our paths cross. Not gonna lie, last year, maybe in August just like this, I was desperate for someone... and for that, this August I have a boy who shows me effort, sends me sweet things, clingy, plays games with me, watches videos, plays sports and plans future with me <3...</p>

    <p>Three months went very fast and it feels like we have known each other for the rest of our lives. I never thought I'd be risking my life just to message, video call to the boy I love. I'm not someone who would vent my disappointing side because I'm ashamed of it but I did with you and I'm glad that I did because you accepted me for who I was and let the past be in the past. Having you by my side I feel like I'm ready to face any challenge I have because I have you as my support and comfort. Not everyone gets to have someone like you Gavin. Specially in Sri Lanka, boys are different. Among them, you truly are a <b>MAN</b>.</p>

    <p>I'd do anything for you Gavin. I don't care even if I had to risk my life for you, as long as I can have you by my side. I want you to know, each day that's passing my love for you keeps growing. I'll always be there for you and support you and go through this journey of yours <b>together</b>. We both would face the highs and the lows, I won't let you go through anything alone in this world. 
	<i><b>Gavin, you are like the shining star in my dark sky. I love you so much...</b></i></p>

<p><b>Baba, I still cant express my love to you by some words...I just want to be there with you. I want to kiss you, cuddle you , annoy you, bite you and (fuck you)...they say most online relationships won't work and teenage but we will overcome this distance and make this work as we grow together. It is true, long distance relationships are truly magical as we fall in love again and again... I once said it and here again I say it baba, Im always ALWAYS here for you üíó not just for presence but to support your journey. If we face it , we face it together, if there are highs and lows , we face it AS ONE. I just want to see you being successful in your journey and your life that you dreamed of baba. And we will create it together. Looking back I see how much we have grown just by supporting eachothee and encouraging eachother and staying there when we need eachother THE MOST. I promise this relationship will only end when both of us are in coffins. I just love you so fucking much baba, maybe im not feeling 100% of love yet because we havent even met yet but this online feeling of love truly tells me that in love between us, there is more to explore and more to feel. Yes, we havent felt 100%love yet because we only express it from words. We will 100% surely feel it after this distance end. I love you.
